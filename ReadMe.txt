This is Grim Groupies originally created for the Ludum Dare 40 Game Jam.

*** This branch is for updates made after the completion of the event, for the original see the master branch. ***

The project has been updated to Unity 2017.3.1f1 and Visual Studio 2013.
Later versions will likely be able to import the project but no guarantees.
You may delete the .sln, .suo, and .csproj files in the top of the sourceProject file to help switching to a different visual studio version.
The build folder will contain a possibly outdated executable exported by Unity as a standalone Windows/Linux/Mac program.
I only have a PC so the other platforms are untested.
Upon reflection I have decided to release the updated version under the CCBy4.0 license.
See more information here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
That being said it is offered as is, and I cannot guarantee any methods used were optimal or even preferred so use and learn from at your own risk.

Alternatively view the original game here: https://kramdar.itch.io/grim-groupies.
Once the updated version is deployable I will make a separate page for it on itch.io.

Thanks!
