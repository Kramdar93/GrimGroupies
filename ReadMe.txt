This is Grim Groupies created for the Ludum Dare 40 Game Jam

It was made with Unity 5.6.3 and Visual Studio 2013.
Later versions will likely be able to import the project but no guarantees.
You may delete the .sln, .suo, and .csproj files in the top of the sourceProject file to help switching to a different visual studio version.
The build folder will contain the executable exported by Unity as a standalone Windows/Linux/Mac program.
I only have a PC so the other platforms are untested.
As per Ludum Dare rules, this project source is published as free to use for any purpose.
I will withhold the right to charge for the executables of future versions of this game, but the project as it is here, upon submission to the Jam, will remain free.
That being said it is offered as is, and I cannot guarantee any methods used were optimal or even preferred.

Thanks for checking this out, I will update with a link to itch.io when I get it set up.

Thanks!
